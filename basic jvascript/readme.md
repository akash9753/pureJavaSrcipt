excecution context has two phase

1.memory creation phase : in this phase javascipt allocate memory for all the variable it stores undefined
                          and for function it stores whole function code

2.code excecution phase : in this phase variable value will be assigned

call stack : bottom of the stack there is global excecution context
             call stack maintains the order of excecution of **execution contexts**
